## About The Church

Central Assembly of God had its beginnings on December 5th, 1954, in the home of Rev. A.J. Carroll. In 1955 land was purchased on West 26th Street for a building to be 
constructed. In 1956 the first construction began and services were held in the basement of the construction site. The congregation changed pastors a couple of times and, 
after much prayer and hard work, a started structure was hit by strong winds and had to be torn down.

In March, 1964, after many years of sacrifice, praying, and hard work, the church moved into its new auditorium where it functioned until 1974 when it began to outgrow its 
facilities. Needing a larger meeting place, the congregation immediately sought a place to grow. That led them to the historic Fox Theater in downtown Joplin that has been 
our home for almost 45 years. It was in the late 1970's that the church name was changed to Central Christian Center.

In 1999 the church added a 1.6-million-dollar addition to the facilities that houses a formal entrance with large stairs, an elevator for the handicapped, church offices, and 
nurseries. Our Pastor, Dr. Hank Deslatte and his wife, Pam, have been capably leading our church family for 16 years. In addition to our weekly services for adults and 
children, life groups, support groups, men's and women's ministries, we have had a television broaddcast for over 32 years, and support several local and world ministries.
