## In the Heart of Joplin, With a Heart for Joplin

Central Christian Center is committed to tell everyone about Jesus Christ and His great love for them. It's our desire to bring people into God's family and help them develop a Christ-like maturity as well as equip them for ministry. Our mission is to inspire people to believe in God and His Son Jesus Christ, by knowing that He has the power to change lives, and by serving our great God and sharing His love with everyone we can. We believe in each other, and in helping one another reach a higher purpose through Jesus Christ.

Located at 410 South Virginia Avenue in Joplin, MO, services are at 10:30 am and 6:00 pm on Sundays with nurseries and youth classes available for all ages. Join us for an anointed and inspired word of God!
