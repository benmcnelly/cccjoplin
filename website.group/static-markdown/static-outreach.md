## Woven

At the end of 2013, the Holy Spirit stirred the hearts of the women of Central Christian Center to unite the five women's groups. They aligned their hearts and vision, to create one group that encompasses all women. On a foundation of prayer and united, Woven was born! Colossians 2:2 says, *“I want them to be encouraged and knit (WOVEN) together by strong ties of love. I want them to have complete confidence that they understand God’s mysterious plan, which is Christ himself.”* We want YOU to be encouraged and WOVEN WITH US and TOGETHER we will come to understand GOD’s plan. So please join with us and other women of faith and let’s weave a great tapestry of love for our church and community.

*I came from institutions and prisons to total freedom! I couldn't, but Jesus could!* - Jimmy

*I was lost in addiction. I was incarcerated for 7 years. I hated who I was and didn't care about anyone. I got saved at a Saturday Night Live meeting. I have a huge, loving family at SNL. I love myself and others.* - Steve

*After 27 years of addiction, I found myself spiritually bankrupt - feeling empty and defeated. Cheating, stealing, manipulation, and adultery were familiar to me. If you are looking for an answer, God IS the answer. What God has done for me, He'll do for you.* - Anthony

*I was lost in drugs and alcohol for 33 years because I was living in denial. I was making bad choices. Since getting saved I am growing and learning to accept myself for who I am. I am living a much simpler life. I have a great family at SNL and hope to help others who have struggled with addiction.* - Renee

*I used drugs for more than 20 years. During the time of my drug use I hurt my family and friends; but through the love of Jesus Christ I stopped using drugs and hurting people. God gave me a second chance and He can give the same to you.* - Troy

*We lived in chaos - counted out by the world - cast out by our families. We both used drugs and had no stability. April's children had to raise themselves because she was incapable while under the influence. Tim was a homeless meth addict for over 15 years and was put in jail over 50 times. We have both been clean since July of 2009 with no desire to use. We were married in December 2009. God has healed our relationships and given us a family at Saturday Night Live. We finally have stability.* - Tim & April

*We both started abusing drugs at the age of 12. We used and cooked meth together. Our daily routine was lying, cheating, and stealing. We had a love/hate relationship. We divorced. Years later Marianne, married to another man and clean for 3 years, was dying of Hep C. Marianne's husband left her while she was in the hospital and I stepped in and took care of her. I stopped using drugs that very day. God DID restore our family! We've been married for 3 years, have great jobs, and stability. We have more than we could ever imagine.* - Ricardo and Marianne

## Bright Futures

Central Christian Center has been a bright futures partner for eight years, and our partnership has grown in that time period. When Central first joined, our partner was Duquesne Elementary, providing us the opportunity to serve around 200 students. When the tornado hit Joplin and it's surrounding communities, Duquesne and Duenweg schools were merged into a single building, and Central began to serve around 310 students. When the new Soaring Heights Elementary school building opened, our service opportunities expanded to 365 students, and now to 435 students.

Bright Futures is an amazing and awesome program that allows the faith-based community into our schools, providing us a way to show the Love of Jesus to the students and teachers with whom we interact. During the course of our involvement we have seen this program's reception evolve from skepticism to trust. With our choice to be actively involved in the schools, we have seized many opportunities to show that we love and care about our schools, teachers, and students, yielding many rewards that escape expression.

**How We Have Helped Make a Difference:**

* While students were working hard on their MAPP tests, we provided snacks and encouragement to each student. We also brought extra pencils.
* We brought snacks and the occasional lunch to teachers and staff on various days throughout the year (like parent-teacher conferences).
* We gave small gifts for teachers and staff on holidays as a token of appreciation for all they do to educate area kids.
* We spent time with the kids reading one-on-one on Dr. Seuss Days.
* We have hosted hat, sock, and glove drives for the kids.
* We provided hygiene products for the kids to help with their hygiene education.
* We participated in fundraising by volunteering at the events and by financially assisting the events.
* We brought pizza for 'Student of the Month' days.
* We helped pay for the T-shirts with the Soaring Heights and CCC logo, along with other Bright Futures partners.
* We provided and gave out wristbands with Soaring Heights and Central Christian Center embossed with school colors to all of the students to encourage them and welcome them to their new school.

## Life Groups

**Life Groups**

*A place where people can come together to connect with others.*

The best way to grow as a Christian is to get into a situation where you can rub shoulders with other Christians and benefit from life-on-life modeling and mentoring from those who've learned what it means to live out their faith on a day-to-day basis. As relationships can't be forced, neither can spiritual growth. Life Groups provide an environment conducive to deeper spiritual relationships among group members. After that, it's up to the Holy Spirit to do His stuff according to a timetable that fits His plan (or in the case of some of us, at the pace at which we're willing to be led.) 

**Life Groups are not in-depth Bible Studies.**

Life Groups are about sharing life together and discovering how the love of God transforms hearts. In Life Groups, instead of talking about life, people engage in it.

**Life Groups are built around 'affinity relationships'.**

Affinity means that people in the Life Group have something basic in common. While it's true that close friends often have a stronger set of shared interests, values, or experiences that binds them together; that's why we tell people to choose a group primarily according to who else is in it rather than where it meets.

**Life Groups are incubators of faith.**

Incubators are warm, safe environments where premature babies are nourished into a sustainable life. That's what happens in Life Groups.

**Life Groups are ideal for new Christians and the 'unchurched'.**

Everyone benefits from a small group, but no one more than new believers or nonbelievers, because they so desperately need to share life with other Christians who have gone before them in their life struggles.

We all have a basic need to connect with others. Life Groups share lives together - the good times, the tough times, and the times in-between. The goal of Life Groups is simply to connect people to the two things they will need most when faced with the challenges of life: the Bible and other Christians.

**The mission of Life Groups is:**

* transforming believers into the image of Christ,
* Equipping them for the work of ministry,
* Strengthening them through teaching and fellowship,
* Renewing them through worship and prayer.

**Life Groups are the solution to disconnection.**

* Life Groups provide fellowship
* Life Groups share life together
* Life Groups change lives

The beauty of this laid-back approach of Life Groups is that it 'takes the pressure off'. Life Groups provide an environment where people are connected closely enough and long enough for life to happen and for God to show up. It's organic and simple; it works, and it works well.

**Life Groups are not a new thing.** 

In the 1st century church, as well as worshiping together in the Temples each day, Christians met in homes where they studied the apostles' teachings, shared meals together, and celebrated the Lord's Supper. "And each day the Lord added to their fellowship those who were being saved." - Acts 2:46-47 (NLT)

Small group bands and classes started by John and Charles Wesley in the 18th century also attracted thousands of spiritually hungry people and grew many of them into mature believers. Anytime a group of friends commits to gather together to share their lives, pray, and discuss the Bible and the application of it's scriptures, good stuff is bound to happen. 

**Why Life Groups?**

Life Groups are all about friends, encouragement, prayer, and the study of God's Word! In a Life Group, you can take a break from the busy demands of everyday life and invest in what is really important: your relationship with God and with the people around you. Most life groups meet for an hour and half every week. In a small group of people things happen that don't happen in bigger groups. The Bible gives us many examples of how lives were changed when people met together this way. The same thing happens as we hear of how Life Groups have provided friendship, support, encouragement, and opportunity for a closer relationship with Christ. Get connected in a life group and watch your life change!
