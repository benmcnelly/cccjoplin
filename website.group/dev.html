      == PLANS FOR THIS SECTION ==
      Move to a 50/50 split with an image for each ministry. As content evolves .... or shows up, being honest...
      links out to individual pages can be established. For the time being, this section will use a 25/25/25/25
      button layout. This works at large resolution, but the CSS for the individual 'buttons' still needs adjusted
      so that it scales properly as sizes decrease. That bit has been put on hold for the moment. This section really
      does eventually need more lead content.

                        At the end of 2013, the Holy Spirit stirred the hearts of the women of Central Christian Center to unite the five women's groups. They aligned their hearts and vision, to create one group that encompasses all women. On a foundation of prayer and united, Woven was born! Colossians 2:2 says, <em>“I want them to be encouraged and knit (WOVEN) together by strong ties of love. I want them to have complete confidence that they understand God’s mysterious plan, which is Christ himself.”</em> We want YOU to be encouraged and WOVEN WITH US and TOGETHER we will come to understand GOD’s plan. So please join with us and other women of faith and let’s weave a great tapestry of love for our church and community.

                        <em>I came from institutions and prisons to total freedom! I couldn't, but Jesus could!</em> - Jimmy<br>
                        <br>
                        <em>I was lost in addiction. I was incarcerated for 7 years. I hated who I was and didn't care about anyone. I got saved at a Saturday Night Live meeting. I have a huge, loving family at SNL. I love myself and others.</em> - Steve<br>
                        <br>
                        <em>After 27 years of addiction, I found myself spiritually bankrupt - feeling empty and defeated. Cheating, stealing, manipulation, and adultery were familiar to me. If you are looking for an answer, God IS the answer. What God has done for me, He'll do for you.</em> - Anthony<br>
                        <br>
                        <em>I was lost in drugs and alcohol for 33 years because I was living in denial. I was making bad choices. Since getting saved I am growing and learning to accept myself for who I am. I am living a much simpler life. I have a great family at SNL and hope to help others who have struggled with addiction.</em> - Renee<br>
                        <br>
                        <em>I used drugs for more than 20 years. During the time of my drug use I hurt my family and friends; but through the love of Jesus Christ I stopped using drugs and hurting people. God gave me a second chance and He can give the same to you.</em> - Troy<br>

                        <em>We lived in chaos - counted out by the world - cast out by our families. We both used drugs and had no stability. April's children had to raise themselves because she was incapable while under the influence. Tim was a homeless meth addict for over 15 years and was put in jail over 50 times. We have both been clean since July of 2009 with no desire to use. We were married in December 2009. God has healed our relationships and given us a family at Saturday Night Live. We finally have stability.</em> - Tim & April<br>
                        <br>
                        <em>We both started abusing drugs at the age of 12. We used and cooked meth together. Our daily routine was lying, cheating, and stealing. We had a love/hate relationship. We divorced. Years later Marianne, married to another man and clean for 3 years, was dying of Hep C. Marianne's husband left her while she was in the hospital and I stepped in and took care of her. I stopped using drugs that very day. God DID restore our family! We've been married for 3 years, have great jobs, and stability. We have more than we could ever imagine.</em> - Ricardo and Marianne<br>

                        Central Christian Center has been a bright futures partner for eight years, and our partnership has grown in that time period. When Central first joined, our partner was Duquesne Elementary, providing us the opportunity to serve around 200 students. When the tornado hit Joplin and it's surrounding communities, Duquesne and Duenweg schools were merged into a single building, and Central began to serve around 310 students. When the new Soaring Heights Elementary school building opened, our service opportunities expanded to 365 students, and now to 435 students.<br>
                        <br>
                        Bright Futures is an amazing and awesome program that allows the faith-based community into our schools, providing us a way to show the Love of Jesus to the students and teachers with whom we interact. During the course of our involvement we have seen this program's reception evolve from skepticism to trust. With our choice to be actively involved in the schools, we have seized many opportunities to show that we love and care about our schools, teachers, and students, yielding many rewards that escape expression.<br>

            <br>
            The best way to grow as a Christian is to get into a 
            situation where you can rub shoulders with other Christians 
            and benefit from life-on-life modeling and mentoring from 
            those who've learned what it means to live out their faith 
            on a day-to-day basis. As relationships can't be forced, 
            neither can spiritual growth. Life Groups provide an 
            environment conducive to deeper spiritual relationships 
            among group members. After that, it's up to the Holy 
            Spirit to do His stuff according to a timetable that fits 
            His plan (or in the case of some of us, at the pace at 
            which we're willing to be led.)

              Studies.</strong>
              <br>
              Life Groups are about sharing life together 
              and discovering how the love of God transforms 
              hearts. In Life Groups, instead of talking about 
              life, people engage in it.
            </li>
            <li class="pageTextOrange"><strong>Life Groups are built around 'affinity 
              relationships'.</strong>
              <br>
              Affinity means that people in the Life Group have 
              something basic in common. While it's true that 
              close friends often have a stronger set of shared 
              interests, values, or experiences that binds them 
              together; that's why we tell people to choose a 
              group primarily according to who else is in it 
              rather than where it meets.
            </li>
            <li class="pageTextOrange"><strong>Life Groups are incubators of faith. 
              </strong>
              <br>
              Incubators are warm, safe environments where 
              premature babies are nourished into a sustainable 
              life. That's what happens in Life Groups.
            </li>
            <li class="pageTextOrange"><strong>Life Groups are ideal for new Christians 
              and the 'unchurched'.</strong>
              <br>
              Everyone benefits from a small group, but no 
              one more than new believers or nonbelievers, 
              because they so desperately need to share life 
              with other Christians who have gone before 
              them in their life struggles.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="pageTextOrange">
            We all have a basic need to connect with others. Life Groups 
            share lives together - the good times, the tough times, 
            and the times in-between. The goal of Life Groups is simply 
            to connect people to the two things they will need most when 
            faced with the challenges of life: the Bible and other 
            Christians.
          </p>
          <p class="pageTextOrange"><strong>The mission of Life Groups is:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li class="pageTextOrange">transforming believers into the image of Christ,</li>
              <li class="pageTextOrange">Equipping them for the work of ministry,</li>
              <li class="pageTextOrange">Strengthening them through teaching and fellowship,</li>
              <li class="pageTextOrange">Renewing them through worship and prayer.</li>
            </ul>
          <p class="pageTextOrange"><strong>Life Groups are the solution to disconnection.</strong></p>
            <ul>

            </ul>
          <p class="pageTextOrange">
            The beauty of this laid-back approach of Life Groups is that it 
            'takes the pressure off'. Life Groups provide an environment where 
            people are connected closely enough and long enough for life to 
            happen and for God to show up. It's organic and simple; it works, 
            and it works well.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Life Groups are not a new thing.</strong>
            <br>
            In the 1st century church, as well as worshiping together in 
            the Temples each day, Christians met in homes where they studied 
            the apostles' teachings, shared meals together, and celebrated 
            the Lord's Supper. "And each day the Lord added to their 
            fellowship those who were being saved." - Acts 2:46-47 (NLT)<br>
            <br>
            Small group bands and classes started by John and Charles Wesley 
            in the 18th century also attracted thousands of spiritually 
            hungry people and grew many of them into mature believers. Anytime 
            a group of friends commits to gather together to share their lives, 
            pray, and discuss the Bible and the application of it's scriptures, 
            good stuff is bound to happen.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Why Life Groups?</strong>
            <br>
            Life Groups are all about friends, encouragement, prayer, and the study 
            of God's Word! In a Life Group, you can take a break from the busy 
            demands of everyday life and invest in what is really important: 
            your relationship with God and with the people around 
            you. Most life groups meet for an hour and half every week. In a 
            small group of people things happen that don't happen in bigger 
            groups. The Bible gives us many examples of how lives were changed 
            when people met together this way. The same thing happens as we 
            hear of how Life Groups have provided friendship, support, 
            encouragement, and opportunity for a closer relationship with Christ. 
            Get connected in a life group and watch your life change!
